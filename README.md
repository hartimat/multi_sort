# Welcome to "multi_sort"!

## [ DESCRIPTION ]
A simple Java app that applies multiple sorting algorithms to input data and outputs the results for comparison.

## [ BACKGROUND ]
This project was part of the Data Structures course work and was intended to gain more exposure to the Java language, as well as implementing basic sorting algorithms.  The program takes user and text file input, applies the selection, insertion, and merge sort algorithms, then generates an output file for the user to compare the performance of each algorithm.


## [ STACK ]
- Java

## [ LESSONS LEARNED ]
This application was helpful to see the different use cases for the various sorting algorithms.  It also demonstrated how implementing each requires different amounts of code and overall effort.  In the future, before selecting sorting algorithms I will more carefully consider the project objectives, available input data, computing resources required, etc.
